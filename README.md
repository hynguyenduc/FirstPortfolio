## Components

Banner: contains img and link elements to act like another homepage button. It is pinned to the top of the page, even when you scroll down the page on phones/tablets.

Blog: contains headings, img and/or paragraph elements to house content

Navigation Bar: contains links and spaced evenly with css grid. Sticky positioned to top of page, even when you scroll down the page on phones/tablets. Makes all the pages permanently in sight of the user to help with browsing the site.

Social: contains links and img elements. This is always at the end of the page. The icons are clickable links that take the user to my Github and LinkedIn if they want to see my work/work history. The links open into a different tab, so the user can still continue browsing the portfolio.
